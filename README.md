# Metro Vancouver Housing Price Analysis (2004–2023)

## Project Overview

This project explores housing price patterns in Metro Vancouver using a publicly available synthetic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to examine how neighborhood, property type, structural housing features, and time relate to market price.

## Research Questions

1. Are there significant price differences across neighborhoods?
2. How does property type relate to market price?
3. Which factors are most associated with market price?

## Key Insights

- Housing prices vary meaningfully across neighborhoods.
- Property type creates clear price stratification (House > Duplex > Condo).
- Temporal trend (Year) is the strongest factor associated with market price.
- Structural housing features show weak linear association in this dataset.
- Time appears to proxy broader macroeconomic housing trends.

## Methods Used

- Data Cleaning (handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouped summary statistics
- Data visualization (ggplot2)
- Correlation analysis

## Tools

- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
