    "The dominant driver of housing price variation in this dataset is time, not property structure. While neighborhood (RQ1) and property type (RQ2) clearly differentiate price levels—with Houses priced above Condos and certain neighborhoods consistently more expensive—the strongest statistical association emerges from Year rather than from structural housing characteristics such as bedrooms or square footage. This indicates that temporal variation explains more price movement than cross-sectional differences in property features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Canadian housing market, this finding is economically intuitive. Over the past two decades, sustained price appreciation—driven by low interest rates, population growth, and strong urban demand—has created a powerful upward trend. In this dataset, Year likely acts as a proxy for these macroeconomic forces rather than being a causal determinant itself. This highlights an important analytical insight: trend-driven correlation can dominate structural effects in time-evolving markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, correlation does not imply causation. The strong association between Year and Market Price does not mean time causes price increases; rather, it reflects underlying economic dynamics and potential confounding variables. A next step would involve controlling for temporal effects within a multivariate regression framework to better isolate structural price determinants."
